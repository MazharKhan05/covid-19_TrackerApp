# covid-19_TrackerApp
App provides data like total no of Infected people count, no of Recovered people and Total no of Death occured due to Covid-19. Counts are basically presented in two ways first Globally and second for Individual Country. All the data counts is being fetched using a Restful API, Good thing of using API is data fetched is updated on daily basis and hence we get updated no of counts daily. For UI Material-UI components are used extensively for user-friendly and responsiveness of app. One of the key feature of this App is dark/light mode using a Toogle button.
